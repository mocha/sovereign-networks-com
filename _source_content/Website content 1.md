# Hi, we're Sovereign Networks. We're a _residential IT boutique_ based in San Antonio, Texas.

# We're here to make your home **smarter**, more **secure**, and completely **private** - and do so without any of big tech's compromises.

## Here's what we do:

1. Design and Build Custom Smart Homes
	1. Let's kick Alexa out for something cooler. We design, build, and maintain *bespoke smart home systems* that enhance your home's aesthetic and automate how you interact with it---and since ours run entirely on your local network, we do so while _protecting_ your privacy instead of threatening it.
	
2. Private Home Security Systems
	1. We'll help you _digitally_ secure your property. We'll upgrade your home network, install smart locks, sensors, and security cameras that run _entirely on your local network_ with 24/7 reliability, no monthly fees, and no risk of leaking your data.

3. Private Data Storage and Processing
	1. We'll take your data back. We build and install *custom in-home servers* that put you in control of your data and bring new power in to your house: from local AI assistants to media servers to secure backups, all without the cloud.

4. Worry-free Maintenance
	1. We'll be your in-house IT and cybersecurity department. We'll monitor your systems, proactively replace anything that we learn to have defects or vulnerabilities, and provide 24/7 support for any issues that arise. Get a fishy email or scary text? We'll check it out.

## Here's why we're different:

1. **We're not a _big tech_ company.** We're local specialists who love sharing our knowledge and excitement (and sometimes a little paranoia) about technology  with our friends and neighbors. We don't have a board of directors so we don't have to "maximize shareholder value" or collect your data so we can sell it to advertisers.

2. **We prioritize privacy and client-ownership in everything we do.** We (genuinely) encourage you to read our [privacy policy](sovereign-networks.com/legal/privacy), [ownership pledge](sovereign-networks.com/legal/pledge), and [warranty](sovereign-networks.com/legal/warranty). They're very short and easy reads, and will make our commitment to you, _and the philosophy behind our services,_ abundantly clear.

3. **Every project is custom-tailored.** We always customize our approach to your needs, but when it comes to smart home installations this is a particular focus. Every fixture will be chosen to fit the aesthetics of your home and any custom dashboards or touch controls will be designed to match--down to bespoke mounting hardware for the devices displaying them.

4. **You can count on us.** We're _real people who live nearby_, and we'll answer the phone and respond to your emails. You'll always know exactly how to reach us (and will get a response) when you need help.

## If any of this speaks to you, you can:

Read more about our [services](services),
learn about our [process](process),
read our legal agreements [here](sovereign-networks.com/legal) (Seriously: they're short, worth reading, and we're proud of them.)
or just dive in and [contact us](contact) so we can get started.

# Our process

Below is the entire lifecycle of a project with us, from start to finish, _including_ what "offboarding" (e.g. you fired us) looks like. We deal with your personal privacy and the projects we engage in are not inexpensive, so _we do not take our process lightly_ nor do we believe in surprising you at any step.

## Ideation to proposal

1. We'll come out to your home, get to know you, and talk about what you need.
2. We'll perform a thorough audit of your home, both the physical space as well as any and all equipment that connects to the internet.
3. We'll send you a proposal—what services we recommend, the timeline, and cost.
4. If you have questions -- "how does _ _ _ work?", "would _ _ _ look good in my home?": we'll demo it or bring one out to show you.

## Agreement and Timeline

5. We'll agree on a timeline and schedule for the project.
6. Everyone will sign agreements:
	- You'll sign the Project Approval for us
	- We'll sign an NDA, Privacy Policy, Unbrickable Pledge, and an Ironclad Warranty for you.

## Design, implementation, and installation

7. Collaborate with you on a detailed plan for the project, including designing dashboards, automations, monitoring, alerts, and more.
8. Build and configure all possible hardware offsite to minimize disruption to your space.
9. Come on-site to do the installation. This depends on the size of the project, but typically takes 1-3 days.
10. When we're done, we'll stick around (or schedule time to come back) to train you on how to use everything. We'll show off every feature, button, switch, and sensor.

## Maintenance and support

All hardware is covered by our [warranty](docs.sn-tx.com/warranty) for 1 year, which includes repair, reconfiguration, or replacement of any devices that are faulty during that period. We know you didn't want "a security camera", you wanted "a clear view of my porch". We'll make sure that's what you get.

Further, if you sign a maintenance contract with us, that will include:

- A 24x7 phone and text hotline for troubleshooting, support, or related technical questions
- Free housecalls within the service area Monday through Friday by appointment
- 1-hour emergency response housecalls for critical issues during business hours
- Proactive monitoring of the health of your network and devices
- Proactive replacement of any hardware or software that we learn to have defects or vulnerabilities
- Quarterly preventative maintenance visits to inspect all installed hardware

## Offboarding

If for any reason, you choose to stop working with us:

- All of the hardware on your property is yours, full-stop. We only sell hardware outright and nothing is ever leased or rented.
- We will provide you with a detailed inventory of what you have, how everything is configured, and how to gain access to every device or service that we've installed or configured.
- We will offer a reduced month-to-month fee to work with another vendor to transfer your systems to them.
- If applicable, we will provide the most recent backup of your data that we have on hand to you.
- We will destroy any data we have about you or your systems that is not specifically required for accounting purposes.

## Services

( mininav )
Smart Home / Home Security / Data Privacy / Maintenance contracts

( big sub )
### Smart Home
There is more to "smart home" than what Alexa, Google, or Samsung offer. A vast ecosystem of devices and services that can be integrated are out there, but the mainstream products are *good enough* that few people will expend the extra effort required to see the benefits of taking their smart home private—exchanging that ease for their privacy, control, and the ability to customize.

If what you're looking for is a few bulbs that you can pick up at Target, hooked up to your Alexa—this is not it.

The modern smarthome ecosystem has every imaginable bulb shape, style, color, and fixture of light available, and if those aren't enough, there are sophisticated switches and relays which can *give* your existing fixtures smart capabilities. No matter what it is, if its electronic, *we can control it.*

You can design absolutely any dashboard or control interface you can imagine to match your tastes and individual needs. We can design anything from minimalist touchscreen panels in your kitchen for controlling the lights, to massive dashboard for your mudroom with the whole family calendar and the weather forecast so you always walk out prepared.

Because you're *not* relying on internet-based services, when your connection goes out, *you can still turn on your lights*. Since you're not connecting to the internet every time you ask a bulb to come on, they respond almost instantly and *consistently*.

Our Smart Home services include:

1. Design and installation of complete smart home systems, including installing light fixtures, switches, sensors, and more. 
2. Configuration of any desired automations or integrations for your home.
3. Design and development of *bespoke* smart home control surfaces and displays
4. Ongoing service, including *4-year warranty* on every device we install while you have an active service contract with us.
5. Phone support 7 days a week, and free housecalls within the service area Monday through Friday by appointment.

### Home Security
We take a holistic approach to residential security—just installing some cameras and a handful of door contact sensors is insufficient and careless. We'll audit your home network and all of the devices you use on it, evaluate the physical security of your property, and recommend a complete plan that takes your devices, your space, *and your lifestyle* in to account.

We'll typically approach this from three angles:
1. **Home network upgrades** - Replace typical residential networking equipment with business-class gear, not only improving the overall security, but increasing wifi coverage and general network performance.
2. **Video surveillance** - Complete external and partial internal video surveillance coverage with modern, high-resolution cameras, recording to a local NVR (network video recorder) system with any amount of desired history retention.
3. **Physical security** - We'll install door contact, motion, light, and sound sensors throughout your home and in critical areas, and integrate them with your surveillance and smart home systems for a complete awareness of your space.

All of this can be "self monitored", as in we install a classic-style dashboard of cameras that you can keep an eye on yourself, or your system can be integrated securely with an independent monitoring vendor such as [Noonlight](https://www.noonlight.com/business/industries/home-security). Unlike traditional systems, all of our sensors will also be fully integrated with a private smart home installation, so you can set up automated triggers between the two so that your security posture is precisely what you need it to be.

We can also recommend (and if desired, manage the subcontracting for) additional physical security improvements—door and wall reinforcement, adding security or privacy film, upgrading locks, and more. Every property is different and has a unique threat model, we're happy to evaluate yours and ensure that it's secure from every angle.

### Data Privacy
*Most* of the internet-based services that you are using are either using your data to advertise to you, or selling that data to advertisers to advertise to you. They will willingly hand that data over to law enforcement with or without due cause, and because there are so many users in one place, they're also "target rich environments" for hackers and scammers.

Unfortunately you can't stop using *any* internet-based service—if your doctor's office has an online portal, you might *have to* use it—but there are many instances where we can start pulling this data back in to our own control through locally-run services or migrating our usage to private, independent services that take your privacy and security more seriously than Amazon or Google will.

If you're already running a local Smart Home or Home Security system, we've already set up a basic local server for you. By upgrading it for additional storage or compute capacity, we can set it up to do a lot doing more:

1. **Locally-hosted AI assistants** that can support the latest LLMs and AI workflows, integrated with your home automation, private chat clients, and other AI-compatible tools.
2. **Secure document storage and device backups** that are fully in your control and redundantly mirrored offsite for complete peace of mind
3. **Private Photo and media management** that won't use all of your media to train facial recognition services or sell that data to anyone else.
4. **Private, high-performance game servers** for your kids and their friends, secure from hackers and private only for their use.
5. **Personal VPN services** for secure access, remotely, to all of your private data, devices, and home controls.

### Maintenance contracts

#### Maintenance and support contracts
We want to be your full-time IT department. Just like you expect out of your IT staff at work, we:

- Maintain your hardware and make sure everything is running smoothly.
- When things go wrong, we'll reconfigure or reset things back in to working order.
- Provide 24x7 on-call support for troubleshooting and technical support for all of our products and services.

All maintenance contracts are *all-inclusive and proactively managed.* We monitor the health of all of the hardware we install for you and call you to schedule a time to come out any time we see that something is off. 

And more generally, just like your IT and security department at work: *if you see something, say something.* Call or text us 24x7 with your sketchy emails, scary text messages, or "I think my kid just got a virus on my PC" questions.

#### Warranties
We do not cut corners, we do not install junk, and we fully stand behind everything we choose to deploy in our client's homes:

- All installed hardware comes with our [ironclad warranty](docs.sn-tx.com/warranty). If something fails or otherwise stops working under normal circumstances, we will make it right, free of charge, within 10 business days.
- Our maintenance contract also extends the warranty:
	- Our hardware warranty is extended to 4 years.
	- We guarantee a maximum 24-hour response time for warranty repair house calls.
	- We will *proactively replace* anything that we learn to have defects or vulnerabilities.

## Frequently asked questions

1. Can you support/deploy/integrate/install _ _ _ _ _ ?
	1. **Yes, we can.** We are a _boutique_ IT shop, so as long as its tech hardware or software: we love a challenge, give us a call.

1. What do you use/recommend for _ _ _ _ _ ?
	- See [docs.sn-tx.com/recs](docs.sn-tx.com/recs) for the current list of recommended hardware and software that we are deploying in the field. Everything on that list is gear or software that we have tested, deployed, and support currently. (Fair warning: it's quite-technical content.)
	- Note that this list _does change regularly_ as we find better products or as we find out that a product doesn't last as long as we'd like or have security vulnerabilities that are discovered. _For our contract clients,_ anything that falls in either of those two categories will be proactively replaced at no cost.

1. What areas do you service?
	- **For hardware installation:** we serve San Antonio, Texas and the surrounding communities. This area includes  Alamo Heights, Boerne, Bulverde, Canyon Lake, Cibolo, Converse, Fair Oaks Ranch, Floresville, Helotes, Hondo, Kirby, Lakehills, Leon Valley, Live Oak, New Braunfels, Pleasanton, Schertz, Seguin, Selma, Terrell Hills, Timberwood Park, Universal City, Uvalde, Windcrest (to name a few).
	- **For maintenance contracts:** your address must be within a 30-minute drive from the San Antonio International Airport. We have a strict commitment in our contract to rapid response time, so locations that don't meet that criteria fall outside of our service area. See the [service area map](https://app.traveltime.com/search?aId=0&0-lat=29.532242429756504&0-lng=-98.47114562988281&0-tt=1800&0-mode=driving+ferry&0-d=2025-01-01T18:00:00.000Z&0-c=blue&0-l=San+Antonio+International+Airport,+9800,+Airport+Boulevard,+San+Antonio,+Bexar+County,+Texas,+78216,+United+States) for details.

1. How much do your services cost?
	- Every client engagement is unique and cost will vary greatly depending on the complexity of what we install. The hardware required for a project including smart home, surveillance, and local server hardware will run between $5,000 to $25,000 depending on the size of the home and desired features.
	- Ongoing contracts are split in to two halves: support and maintenance. 
		- Support fees start at $250/month and increase based on the size of the home and number of occupants. 
		- Maintenance fees start at $250/month and increase based on the amount and complexity of the deployed hardware that we're managing.
	- All ongoing contracts require a minimum 1-year commitment. 
	- We offer a 10% discount for contracts paid annually, and another 10% for contracts of 3 years or more.

1. Do you offer emergency support?
	- Absolutely. All clients on contract get 24/7 phone (or text) support, and during business hours we can have someone on-site within 1 hour.
	- If you _don't have a contract_, and are having a critical IT emergency: give us a call anyway and we'll work something out.

1. How are you able to guarantee you'll always answer the phone or come out to my house on time?
	- Simple: we don't sign more clients than we can support. Our commitment is to providing the best possible service, and you can't do that when your staff is stretched too thin or always too busy. 

1. Why do you have public documentation?
	- Our clients *completely own* their installations—we just manage and support them. As such, it's only right that we provide at least basic documentation that describes what things are, how they work, and a general sense of the lay of the land.
