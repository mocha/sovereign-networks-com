# Ownership Pledge

On of February 18, 2025, the entire Sovereign Networks team hereby affirms our intent to ensure your access to the devices and services we install, provide, configure, develop, or otherwise manage for you.

We commit to providing you with any information required to access those devices and services, and in the event that you discontinue your relationship with us or if and when we ever become insolvent as a company, we will still maintain that commitment.

This commitment has been recorded by [The Internet Archive]() and in this [website's commit history]() for long-term reference and historical documentation, and will include a signed copy of it with every engagement agreement we sign.

Less formally, what we're saying is: _We will never brick your stuff._

We will never _knowingly remove_ your access to stuff you should have access to or prevent you from accessing your stuff through _purposeful inaction_. In the event that you fire us _or we go out of business_, we will maintain that commitment and provide you with what you need to access your stuff without us.

If and when we part ways, you will leave with:

- An inventory of the hardware, devices, products, or services we were managing for you
- Any configuration information or documentation we have on file for your stuff
- Any logins, passwords, keys, or access devices required to gain access to that stuff

---

Our goal with this pledge is to make our intent abundantly clear and to alleviate any concerns you may have about the ownership and control of the devices and services we install and manage for you. 

If we missed the mark and you still have concerns, please reach out directly to admin@sovereign-networks.com so we can clarify for you and amend this pledge if needed.

> This pledge is inspired by [TRMNL's Unbrickable pledge](https://usetrmnl.com/blog/the-unbrickable-pledge), which we have the absolute utmost respect for. We are not affiliated with TRMNL, and this pledge is not endorsed by them, but it has inspired us to do the same and we hope we can inspire others to continue to follow their lead.
