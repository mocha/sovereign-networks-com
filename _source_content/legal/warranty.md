# Warranty

All hardware we install is covered by a minimum of a 1-year warranty from the manufacturer. You don't need to worry about that: we'll honor the terms of any manufacturer's warranty ourselves so you don't have to deal with them.

We recognize that you didn't want "a security camera", you wanted "a clear view of my porch". We'll make sure that's what you get: proposals will include a list of _experience requirements_ which the hardware installed must meet the requirements of as part of their warranty terms.
